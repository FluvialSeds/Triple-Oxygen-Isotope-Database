# Triple-Oxygen-Isotope-Database
---

A compiled and curated compilation of experimental, atmospheric, and geologic triple-oxygen isotope compositions, including an inter-laboratory comparison of standard results. This database was generated for the 2024 Treatise on Geochemistry chapter "Mass independent fractionation processes in the atmosphere" by Jordon Hemingway and Mark Claire, and it was used for the figures and analysis within.
